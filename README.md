# vfiler.vim: File explorer plugin for Vim/Neovim

## Description
- **File manager**

  You can perform basic operations such as selecting, creating, deleting,
  copying, moving, and renaming files.

- **Operation between multiple buffers**

  It can be treated as 2 window filer. This makes file operations easier to
  handle.

- **Not depends on other plugins.**

  It works independently without relying on other plugins.

  Aiming for the necessary and sufficient functions to increase working
  efficiency and their lightweight operation.

### *In preparation*

I am hoping to continually improve it as far as time permits,
