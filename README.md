# File explorer plugin for Vim/Neovim

## Description

- **File manager**

  You can perform basic operations such as selecting, creating, deleting,
  copying, moving, and renaming files.

- **Operation between multiple buffers**

  It can be treated as 2 window filer. This makes file operations easier to
  handle.

- **Not depends on other plugins.**

  It works independently without relying on other plugins.

- **Required enough feature, lightweight operation**

  Aiming for the necessary and sufficient functions to increase working
  efficiency and their lightweight operation.

## Requirements

vfiler.vim requires Neovim(0.5.0+) or Vim8.2+ with [if\_lua](https://vimhelp.org/if_lua.txt.html#if_lua.txt).

## Instalattion

### Using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```vim
Plug 'obaland/vfiler.vim'
```

### Using [dein.vim](https://github.com/Shougo/dein.vim)

```vim
call dein#add('obaland/vfiler.vim')
```
## Usage
### Quick Start
Basically, after installing in any way, start with the **VFiler** command.

    :VFiler [{options}...] [{path}]

If {path} is not specified, it will start in the current directory.
{options} are options for a filer buffer.
Please see the [documentation][vim-doc] for details.

### Start by calling a lua function
vfiler can also be started by calling a lua function.
```lua
require('vfiler').start(path)
```

    auto_cd = true,
    auto_resize = true,
    keep = true,

  },
}

require('vfiler').start()
```

## Lastly
I am hoping to continually improve it as far as time permits,  
so I'd appreciate it if you can receive various opinions including differences within the script.
